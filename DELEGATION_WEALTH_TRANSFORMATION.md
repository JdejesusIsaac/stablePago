# Delegation Feature Transformation: Shopping → Wealth Creation

## 📊 Product Vision Alignment

**Previous Focus**: Telegram Shopping (grocery, pharmacy, retail purchases)  
**New Focus**: Wealth Automation (auto-investment, family wallets, financial empowerment)

This transformation aligns the delegation feature with StablePago's core mission: **Building Caribbean Prosperity Through Automated Wealth Creation**.

---

## 🎯 Key Changes Overview

### 1. **Delegation Types (Previously: Single "Shopping" Mode)**

#### **Auto-Investment Delegation** 📈
- **Purpose**: Automate wealth building through RWA (Real-World Asset) investments
- **Mechanism**: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into tokenized assets
- **Assets Supported**:
  - 💵 **USDC Savings** - Dollar-denominated savings vault (safe harbor)
  - 🏆 **PAXG** - Gold-backed tokens (inflation hedge)
  - 📊 **ONDO** - Tokenized U.S. Treasuries (4-5% APY safe yield)
  - 🏛️ **USYC** - US Yield Coin (Treasury-backed stablecoin)

**Spending Limits**:
- Daily investment limit (default: $20)
- Weekly investment limit (default: $100)
- Monthly investment limit (default: $400)
- Approval threshold for large investments (default: $50)
- Duration: 7 days to 1 year (recommended: 90 days for compounding)

**Use Case Example**:
> *"Maria receives $200/month in remittances. She configures 20% ($40) to auto-invest: 50% USDC savings, 30% PAXG (gold), 20% ONDO (treasuries). Over 12 months, she accumulates $480 + yields (~$25), totaling $505 in wealth—all automated."*

#### **Family Wallet Delegation** 👨‍👩‍👧
- **Purpose**: Share controlled wallet access with family members (elderly parents, dependents)
- **Mechanism**: Create a delegated wallet with spending limits and withdrawal-only mode
- **Configuration**:
  - Recipient name (e.g., "Grandma Maria")
  - Daily withdrawal limit (default: $50)
  - Withdraw-only mode (blocks transfers/investments)
  - Duration: 7 days to 1 year

**Security Features**:
- Daily withdrawal caps
- Withdraw-only mode (no risky operations)
- Revocable anytime
- Real-time monitoring

**Use Case Example**:
> *"Juan sends $300/month to his mother in Puerto Rico. He creates a family wallet for her with $50/day limit, withdraw-only mode. She can access funds for groceries and medicine via Telegram without navigating complex crypto."*

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates Required

### **Updated `delegations` Table** (Supabase Migration Needed)

```sql
ALTER TABLE delegations
  ADD COLUMN delegation_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (delegation_type IN ('auto_invest', 'family_wallet')),
  ADD COLUMN monthly_limit NUMERIC(18, 6),
  ADD COLUMN recipient_name VARCHAR(100),
  ADD COLUMN withdraw_only BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  ADD COLUMN investment_allocation TEXT[]; -- Array of asset IDs: ['usdc', 'paxg', 'ondo', 'usyc']

-- Make per_item_limit nullable (only relevant for shopping, not investment)
ALTER TABLE delegations ALTER COLUMN per_item_limit DROP NOT NULL;

-- Add index for delegation_type
CREATE INDEX idx_delegations_type ON delegations(delegation_type);
```

### **New Records Format**

**Auto-Invest Example**:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "bot_address": "0x...",
  "delegation_type": "auto_invest",
  "daily_limit": 20,
  "weekly_limit": 100,
  "monthly_limit": 400,
  "approval_threshold": 50,
  "investment_allocation": ["usdc", "paxg", "ondo"],
  "valid_until": "2025-04-29T00:00:00Z",
  "is_active": true
}
```

**Family Wallet Example**:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "bot_address": "0x...",
  "delegation_type": "family_wallet",
  "recipient_name": "Grandma Maria",
  "daily_limit": 50,
  "withdraw_only": true,
  "valid_until": "2025-04-29T00:00:00Z",
  "is_active": true
}
```

## 🎓 Educational Messaging for Users

### **What is Auto-Investment?**
> *"Auto-investment transforms your remittances into wealth. Instead of spending everything immediately, a small percentage is automatically invested in real-world assets like gold and U.S. Treasuries. Over time, these assets grow and protect your money from inflation."*

### **Why RWA Tokens?**
> *"RWA (Real-World Asset) tokens represent ownership of physical assets like gold bars or U.S. government bonds. They're safer than speculative crypto because they're backed by real value. PAXG = 1 ounce of gold. ONDO = U.S. Treasury bills earning 4-5% per year."*

### **What is Dollar-Cost Averaging?**
> *"DCA means investing small amounts regularly (e.g., $10/week) instead of one large sum. This reduces risk because you buy assets at different prices. If gold goes down, you buy more; if it goes up, you profit. It's how smart investors build wealth over time."*

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Notes

### **Smart Contract Safety**
- Only use audited RWA token contracts (PAXG, ONDO verified)
- Implement slippage protection on Uniswap swaps (max 2%)
- Multi-sig approval for bot wallet fund management

### **Regulatory Compliance**
- Investment delegation does NOT constitute investment advice
- Users maintain self-custody (non-custodial wallets)
- KYC/AML checks via Circle for fiat off-ramps
- Travel Rule compliance for transactions ≥ $3,000

### **Risk Disclosures**
- Display clear disclaimers: "Crypto investments carry risk. Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns."
- RWA tokens subject to market fluctuations
- ONDO and USYC require accredited investor status in some jurisdictions (research needed)

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

1. **Custom Asset Allocations**: Let users set % splits (e.g., 40% USDC, 30% PAXG, 30% ONDO)
2. **Rebalancing**: Automatically rebalance portfolio to target allocation quarterly
3. **Yield Optimization**: Auto-switch between Aave, Compound for best USDC rates
4. **Tax Reporting**: Generate CSV exports for capital gains/losses
5. **Social Proof**: "1,250 users have invested $125K in RWAs this month"
6. **Referral Bonuses**: "$10 USDC bonus when you enable auto-invest"

## ✨ Key Takeaways

### **Why This Transformation Matters**

1. **Mission Alignment**: StablePago's core value prop is **wealth creation**, not shopping. This update makes the delegation feature a powerful wealth-building tool.

2. **Product Differentiation**: No other remittance app offers automated RWA investing or family wallet delegation. This is a **category-defining feature**.

3. **User Empowerment**: Auto-investment requires ZERO financial literacy. Set it once, build wealth forever. Family wallets solve real pain points for elderly recipients.

4. **Revenue Opportunity**: 0.5% AUM fee on $5M invested = $25K annual revenue. This scales with user growth and remittance volume.

5. **Compounding Impact**: A user investing $40/month at 5% APY accumulates $2,640 after 5 years (vs $2,400 without yields). This is **generational wealth** for families earning $200/month.
